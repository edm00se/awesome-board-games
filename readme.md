The objective is to use a striker disk with a flick of a finger to hit black or white lighter disks called carrom men and put them in the pockets present at the corners. The aim of the game is to pot (pocket) one's nine carrom men and the queen before the other opponent does. The carrom queen is analogous to the 8 ball (black ball) in the game of eight-ball pool.

### [That's A Question﹗](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/226322/s-question)

> A great game to play with people you think you know. You take the role of squirrels asking each other questions as they climb up a mountain. Players assemble questions from tiles in their hands, asking each other things like "Would you rather live in a world without pizza or fruit?" or "Would you rather write the Great American Novel or never have to sleep again?" It's a good time for everyone, and the game has this nice, innocent charm to it. Even the manual is fun to read.

> In the most distant reaches of the world, magic still exists, embodied by spirits of the land, of the sky, and of every natural thing. As the great powers of Europe stretch their colonial empires further and further, they will inevitably lay claim to a place where spirits still hold power - and when they do, the land itself will fight back alongside the islanders who live there.

### [Bears vs. Babies](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/211534/bears-vs-babies)

> Bears vs Babies is a card game in which you build handsome, incredible monsters who go to war with horrible, awful babies. The shared deck of cards consists of bear parts (and other monster parts) and baby cards. When you draw a part, you use it to build a monster for yourself; when you draw a baby, it goes in the center of the table. When babies are provoked, they attack, and anyone who has fewer monster parts than the number of attacking babies loses their monster; everyone with more parts than babies defeats this infantile army and scores.

### [Joking Hazard](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/193621/joking-hazard)

> From the creators of Cyanide & Happiness comes a card game where players compete to finish an awful comic strip.
> The creators said: "Someone on the Internet once told us that making stick figure comics is easy as hell, and that we were ugly and stupid.They were right on all counts. So, after crying for a few hours, we created the Random Comic Generator which since its inception in 2014 has entertained millions with its computer-generated comedy. After a few weeks of playing with the Random Comic Generator, we started to wonder if its hundreds of random panels might lend themselves to a card game, where you compete against your friends to finish a comic with a funny punchline. So we printed out all of the RCG panels and started playing with them." Draw 7 cards. The deck plays the first card, select a Judge to play the second, then everyone selects a third card to create a three panel comic strip. The Judge picks a winner. The game includes a deck of 250 unique panel cards - that’s 15.4 million combinations of comics!

### [Monopoly](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/41186/monopoly-city)

> At first you think you are playing good old Monopoly where they just add some extra buildings to give a little twist. But the longer you play, the more you realise they actually made a whole new game. You start with more money than usual, which gives you the idea you will last longer (with a bit of luck maybe). The fact that now you can build right away when you bought a property, gives so much dynamic to the game. No more waiting until you have the whole set, or not having the set because one player refuses to trade. Even with a couple of single properties you can win the game.
